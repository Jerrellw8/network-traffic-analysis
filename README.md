# Network Traffic Analysis: TCP/TLS Session Review

## Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis of a TCP/TLS session using Wireshark, specifically focusing on ACK packet patterns and secure data download behavior.

## Summary
- Internal host initiated secure connection to external server over port 443.
- TCP 3-way handshake completed successfully.
- High volume of ACK packets observed, confirming ongoing data transfer.
- TLSv1.2 encryption used, typical of HTTPS downloads.

## Files
- `Network_Traffic_Analysis_Report.docx`: Full incident report.
- `wireshark_log.pcapng`: Screenshot of the TCP ACK stream.
- (Optional) `capture.pcap`: Raw packet data (if anonymized).

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Microsoft Word
